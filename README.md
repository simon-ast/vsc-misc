# Miscellaneous vsc4 scripts

Here is a collection of scripts I used on the vsc4 in tandem with running NIRVANA. They are comprised of:

(a) job_RAW.sh:             Blueprint for starting a slurm job by compiling NIRVANA and other miscellaneous operations.

(b) scr_caivs:              Interactive script to run CAIVS data conversion.

(c) scr_check_progress.sh:  Interactive script to check the end of a nirvana.log file.

(d) get_results.sh:         Interactive script to generate a temporary folder for CAIVS transformations while simulation is still running.

(e) scr_monitoring.sh:      Monitors all processes running under my user-id on vsc4 (updates every second until cancelled).

(f) scr_nodeusage.sh:       Monitors all processes running from the users on the Star/Planet group nodes (not continuous).
